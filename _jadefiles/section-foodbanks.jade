      H3 The House of Bread's Food Bank...
      p The House of Bread Food Bank has two main functions. The first function is to supplement those who have food but for some reason need that extra support. This could be someone who has to decide between paying bills or buying food, or an elderly person who may not be able to leave the house to buy food due to ill health or bad weather. The second function is to supply people who are either homeless or without regular accommodation.

      h3 What we need...
      p Due to the two main functions of the food bank anything that is donated will have some level of demand. However this being said, some food stuffs are more popular than others and therefore need more donations. These popular products are as follows:
